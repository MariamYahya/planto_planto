 Wheat is the most important and dominating crop in Pakistan in terms of production and
acreage, which is grown on 37% of the cultivated area, accounting for 70% of the total production. However,
wheat yield is highly affected by stripe rust, which is considered the most devastating fungal disease,
causing 5.5 million tonnes of loss per year globally. In order to minimize this loss, the accurate and
timely detection of rust disease is crucial instead of manual inspection. Towards this end, we propose a
system to detect wheat rust disease and classify its infection types into four classes, including healthy,
resistant, moderate (moderately resistant to moderately susceptible), and susceptible. The wheat rust dataset
is collected indigenously from the National Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad. A pre-trained U2 Net
model is used to remove the background and extract the leaf containing the rust disease. Subsequently, two
deep learning classifiers, including the Xception model and ResNet-50 are applied to classify the stripe rust
severity levels, where the ResNet-50 model outperformed with the highest accuracy of 96%.
